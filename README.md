# PerfectFit – AI-Powered Outfit Selection Using Genetic Algorithms  

## Project Overview  
PerfectFit is an AI-powered **outfit selection system** that utilizes **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** to generate **optimal outfit recommendations** based on user preferences and constraints. The system enhances **decision-making** in fashion by considering factors such as **dress code, budget, color coordination, and comfort level**.  

By applying **selection, crossover, and mutation techniques**, the algorithm evolves and refines outfit combinations to provide **personalized and optimized recommendations**.  

## Key Features  
• **AI-Based Outfit Recommendations:** Finds the best outfit based on user-defined constraints.  
• **Fitness Function Optimization:** Evaluates outfit suitability using **budget, color, comfort, and style**.  
• **Genetic Algorithm Implementation:** Uses **selection, crossover, and mutation** to refine results.  
• **Personalized & Adaptive Results:** Continuously improves outfit selection through multiple generations.  
• **Performance Analysis & Visualization:** Tracks fitness score progression over time.  

## Technologies & Tools Used  
 **Python** (Genetic Algorithm Implementation)  
 **NumPy & Pandas** (Data Handling)  
 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Visualization & Performance Tracking)  
 **Genetic Operators (Selection, Crossover, Mutation)**
